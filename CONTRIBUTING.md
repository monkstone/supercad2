## Contributing
In the spirit of [free software][free-sw], **everyone** is encouraged to help improve this project.

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting/implementing new features ( _export of spheres direct to povray_ )
* by writing or editing documentation ( _expert Windows users could help write install instructions_ )
* by contributing examples ( _show your creativity, or translate someone elses masterpiece_ )
* by closing [issues][]
* by proselytizing supercad2, we need more champions
* by supporting [Processing.org][], nothing to do with us but we rely on them
* by contributing to[Povray.org][], development

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features. Before
submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, ideally include a [Gist][]
that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce
the bug, and operating system.
